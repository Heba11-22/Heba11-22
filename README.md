### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a mission-driven full-stack software engineer with experience in Python, JavaScript, React, and Redux.
As a web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, helping others, and transforming a vision into a reality to make things that make a difference.
When I am not coding, I like to travel, cook, explore new things, and spend time with my wonderful family.
If you think we can co-create something that can make the world better, let's talk!
